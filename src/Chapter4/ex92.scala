//Exercise 92: Is a Number Prime?
//(Solvedâ€”28 Lines)
//A prime number is an integer greater than 1 that is only divisible by one and itself.
//Write a function that determines whether or not its parameter is prime, returning
//True if it is, and False otherwise. Write a main program that reads an integer
//from the user and displays a message indicating whether or not it is prime. Ensure
//that the main program will not run if the file containing your solution is imported
//into another program.
